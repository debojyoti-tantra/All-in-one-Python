# The random-access memory is volatile, and all its contents are lost once a program terminates. In order to persist the data forever, we use files.

# A file is data stored in a storage device. A python program can talk to the file by reading content from it and writing content to it.

# There are 2 types of files:
    1. Text files (.txt, .c, etc)
    2. Binary files (.jpg, .dat, etc)

# MODES OF OPENING A FILE
    r – open for reading
    w - open for writing 
    a - open for appending
    + - open for updating.
    ‘rb’ will open for read in binary mode.
    ‘rt’ will open for read in text mode.
