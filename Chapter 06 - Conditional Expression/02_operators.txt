RELATIONAL OPERATORS
Relational Operators are used to evaluate conditions inside the if statements. Some examples of relational operators are:
==: equals.
> =: greater than/ equal to.
< =: lesser than/ equal to.

LOGICAL OPERATORS
In python logical operators operate on conditional statements. For Example:
• and – true if both operands are true else false.
• or – true if at least one operand is true or else false.
• not – inverts true to false & false to true.
