First we defined
stone = 1
paper = 2
scissor = 3

chose randon number from computer within 1,2,3 
by useing:
import random
computer = random.choice([1, 2, 3])

then i make dict to convert str to num and reverse dict to convert num to str as i need

then i use
you = your_dict[your_numb]
your_numb is take as input and that str put into your_dict and convert it into num

then use if-elif-else ladder
